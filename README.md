## SETUP
### Getting Started (new machines)
1. Clone repo
2. `./gradlew applyPatches` from root

## REPO SYNC
1. `git checkout main` - switch to the main branch, that tracks Paper
2. via Github UI, PR all new changes into main
> [!TIP]  
> While we're on 1.21.4, so long as all the changes are desired we can just `git merge main` from the `seed` branch to include everything.
3. Make a list of any code that should make it into Aincrad
4. `git checkout seed`
5. `git cherry-pick <new_paper_goodness_commit_hash>`
6. `gradlew applyPatches` - this makes sure your patch/source files are in sync. Forgetting this step will lead to errors the next time you `rebuildPatches`
7. Push the changes back to origin, all done!

> [!NOTE]
> for mistakes,  
> Reset all non-committed local changes: `git reset --hard`  
> Reset branch to remote state: `git reset --hard origin/seed`  
> Reset to specific commit: `git reset --hard <commit-hash>`,  
>   then `git push origin seed --force`

## BUILD
1. Go to the gradle tasks -> bundling
2. `createMojmapBundlerJar`

## CHANGES
### Apply Changes (per-file)
1. Make changes (in paper-server/src/minecraft/java)
2. `./gradlew fixupSourcePatches`
3. `./gradlew rebuildPatches`

### Apply Changes (feature)
1. Make changes (in paper-server/src/minecraft/java)
2. `git add .` in the java subfolder
3. `git commit -m` with the patch message (it will become the patch filename)
4. `./gradlew rebuildPatches` from root

#### Add files for patching
find the file needed using "view source" or manually in the gradle cache, add the full classpath to `./build-data/dev-imports.txt`, run the Gradle task "applyPatches", and you should be able to find your new NMS file in the `./Paper-Server` dir.
